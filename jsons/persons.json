Ford’s career started in 1964 when he travelled to California in search of a voice-over job. He never received that position, but instead signed a contract with Columbia Pictures where he earned $150 weekly to play small fill in roles in various films.\n\nThrough the ’60s Ford worked on several TV shows including Gunsmoke, Ironside, Kung Fu, and American Style. It wasn’t until 1967 that he received his first credited role in the Western film, A Time for Killing. Dissatisfied with the meager roles he was being offered, Ford took a hiatus from acting to work as a self-employed carpenter. This seemingly odd diversion turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Harrison’s acting career when he was soon hired by famous film producer George Lucas. This was a turning point in Ford’s life that led to him be casted in milestone roles such as Han Solo and Indiana Jones.\n\nSince his most famous roles in the original Star Wars trilogy and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Ford has appeared in over 40 films. Many criticize his late-career work, saying his performances have been lackluster, leading to commercially disappointing films. Ford has always worked hard to protect his off-screen private life, keeping details about his children and marriages quiet. He has a total of five children including one recent adoption with third and current wife Calista Flockhart. In addition to acting, Ford is passionate about environmental conservation, aviation, and archeology.","biography_ru":"Legendary Hollywood Icon Harrison Ford was born on July 13, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois.

Ford’s career started in 1964 when he travelled to California in search of a voice-over job. He never received that position, but instead signed a contract with Columbia Pictures where he earned $150 weekly to play small fill in roles in various films.\n\nThrough the ’60s Ford worked on several TV shows including Gunsmoke, Ironside, Kung Fu, and American Style. It wasn’t until 1967 that he received his first credited role in the Western film, A Time for Killing. Dissatisfied with the meager roles he was being offered, Ford took a hiatus from acting to work as a self-employed carpenter. This seemingly odd diversion turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Harrison’s acting career when he was soon hired by famous film producer George Lucas. This was a turning point in Ford’s life that led to him be casted in milestone roles such as Han Solo and Indiana Jones.\n\nSince his most famous roles in the original Star Wars trilogy and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Ford has appeared in over 40 films. Many criticize his late-career work, saying his performances have been lackluster, leading to commercially disappointing films. Ford has always worked hard to protect his off-screen private life, keeping details about his children and marriages quiet. He has a total of five children including one recent adoption with third and current wife Calista Flockhart. In addition to acting, Ford is passionate about environmental conservation, aviation, and archeology.","place_of_birth_en":"Chicago, Illinois, USA","place_of_birth_ru":"Chicago, Illinois, USA","settings":{"tags":[]}},{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Batista","Dave Batista","Deacon Batista","David Bautista","Leviathan","Дэйв Батиста","데이브 바티스타","Ντέιβ Μπαουτίστα","The Animal","Batista Bomb","デイヴ・バウティスタ","戴夫·巴帝斯塔","David Micheal Bautista Jr.","דייוויד מייקל \"דייב\" באוטיסטה ג'וניור"],"birthday":"1969-01-18","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":"https://www.wwe.com/superstars/batista","id":543530,"imdb_id":"nm1176985","known_for_department":"Acting","popularity":25.108,"profile_path":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/sAeWLLUFEVggkLjrnkI6NiUMtLO.jpg","name_en":"Dave Bautista","name_ru":"Dave Bautista","biography_en":"David Michael Bautista Jr. (born January 18, 1969) is an American actor of Filipino-Greek descent and retired professional wrestler.

She has received various accolades, including a Tony Award and a British Academy Film Award, in addition to nominations for two Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards.\n\nJohansson aspired to be an actress from an early age and first appeared on stage in an Off-Broadway play as a child actor. She made her film debut in the fantasy comedy North (1994), and gained early recognition for her roles in Manny & Lo (1996), The Horse Whisperer (1998), and Ghost World (2001). Johansson shifted to adult roles in 2003 with her performances in Lost in Translation, which won her a BAFTA Award for Best Actress, and Girl with a Pearl Earring. She was nominated for Golden Globe Awards for these films, and for playing a troubled teenager in the drama A Love Song for Bobby Long (2004) and a seductress in psychological thriller Match Point (2005). The latter was her first collaboration with Woody Allen, who later directed her in Scoop (2006) and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008).\n\nJohansson's other works of this period include The Prestige (2006) and the albums Anywhere I Lay My Head (2008) and Break Up (2009), both of which charted on the Billboard 200. In 2010, Johansson debuted on Broadway in a revival of A View from the Bridge, which won her a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress, and began portraying Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Iron Man 2. She reprised the role in eight films, most recently in her solo feature Black Widow (2021), gaining global recognition for her performances. During this period, Johansson starred in the science fiction films Her (2013), Under the Skin (2013) and Lucy (2014).\n\nShe received two simultaneous Academy Award nominations—Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress—for the respective roles of an actress going through a divorce in the drama Marriage Story (2019) and a single mother in Nazi Germany in the satire Jojo Rabbit (2019). Labeled a sex symbol, Johansson has been referred to as one of the world's most attractive women by various media outlets. She is a prominent brand endorser and supports several charitable causes. Divorced from actor Ryan Reynolds and businessman Romain Dauriac, Johansson has been married to comedian Colin Jost since 2020. She has two children, one with Dauriac and another with Jost.","place_of_birth_en":"New York City, New York, USA","place_of_birth_ru":"New York City, New York, USA","settings":{"tags":[]}},{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["رايان رينولدز","라이언 레이놀즈","ライアン・レイノルズ","ไรอัน เรย์โนลส์","萊恩·雷諾斯","Ryan Rodney Reynolds","Ράιαν Ρέινολντς","瑞安·雷诺兹","Champ Nightengale","রায়ান রেনল্ডস্","ראיין רנולדס","Рајан Рејнолдс"],"birthday":"1976-10-23","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":10859,"imdb_id":"nm0005351","known_for_department":"Acting","popularity":100.661,"profile_path":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/2Orm6l3z3zukF1q0AgIOUqvwLeB.jpg","name_en":"Ryan Reynolds","name_ru":"Ryan Reynolds","biography_en":"Ryan Rodney Reynolds (born October 23, 1976) is a Canadian actor and film producer.

За эту роль он получил премию «Золотой глобус» и был номинирован на премию «Оскар», как лучший актёр второго плана. Впоследствии его не раз номинировали, в том числе и на лучшую мужскую роль за роль в фильме о неонацистах «Американская история Икс». Всемирную славу снискал за участие в экранизации романа Чака Паланика «Бойцовский клуб».\n\nВ том же году отказался от роли рядового Райана в фильме «Спасти рядового Райана». Продюсеры «Американского психопата» хотели, чтобы он также сыграл роль Патрика Бэйтмана.

В 2008 году Эдвард сыграл Брюса Беннера в фильме «Невероятный Халк», который получил почти исключительно положительные отзывы критиков. Из-за творческих разногласий с Marvel Studios Нортон отказался от роли Брюса Беннера в «Мстителях», и его заменили на Марка Руффало.\n\nВ 2014 году исполнил роль бродвейского актёра в чёрной комедии «Бёрдмэн».

As of 2019, his films have grossed over $7.2 billion worldwide, and he has been placed eight times in annual rankings of the world's highest-paid actors.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, DiCaprio began his career in the late 1980s by appearing in television commercials. In the early 1990s, he had recurring roles in various television shows, such as the sitcom Parenthood, and had his first major film part as author Tobias Wolff in This Boy's Life (1993). At age 19, he received critical acclaim and his first Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for his performance as a developmentally disabled boy in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993). He achieved international stardom with the star-crossed romances Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997).\n\nAfter the latter became the highest-grossing film at the time, he reduced his workload for a few years. In an attempt to shed his image of a romantic hero, DiCaprio sought roles in other genres, including crime drama in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002); the latter marked the first of his many successful collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. DiCaprio portrayed Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) and received acclaim for his performances in the political thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the crime drama The Departed (2006), and the romantic drama Revolutionary Road (2008).\n\nIn the following decade, DiCaprio starred in several high-profile directors' projects, including the science fiction thriller Inception (2010), the western Django Unchained (2012), the biopic The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), the survival drama The Revenant (2015), for which he won an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the comedy-drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), all of which were critical and commercial successes.\n\nDiCaprio is the founder of Appian Way Productions, a production company that has produced some of his films and the documentary series Greensburg (2008–2010), and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness. He regularly supports charitable causes and has produced several documentaries on the environment.

As of 2019, his films have grossed over $7.2 billion worldwide, and he has been placed eight times in annual rankings of the world's highest-paid actors.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, DiCaprio began his career in the late 1980s by appearing in television commercials. In the early 1990s, he had recurring roles in various television shows, such as the sitcom Parenthood, and had his first major film part as author Tobias Wolff in This Boy's Life (1993). At age 19, he received critical acclaim and his first Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for his performance as a developmentally disabled boy in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993). He achieved international stardom with the star-crossed romances Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997).\n\nAfter the latter became the highest-grossing film at the time, he reduced his workload for a few years. In an attempt to shed his image of a romantic hero, DiCaprio sought roles in other genres, including crime drama in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002); the latter marked the first of his many successful collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. DiCaprio portrayed Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) and received acclaim for his performances in the political thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the crime drama The Departed (2006), and the romantic drama Revolutionary Road (2008).\n\nIn the following decade, DiCaprio starred in several high-profile directors' projects, including the science fiction thriller Inception (2010), the western Django Unchained (2012), the biopic The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), the survival drama The Revenant (2015), for which he won an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the comedy-drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), all of which were critical and commercial successes.\n\nDiCaprio is the founder of Appian Way Productions, a production company that has produced some of his films and the documentary series Greensburg (2008–2010), and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness. He regularly supports charitable causes and has produced several documentaries on the environment.
